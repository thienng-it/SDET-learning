1. When testing async code:
    - Without "Await" --> you're working with a Promise object.
    - With "Await" --> you're working with the real resolved value.

Thus,
    async function demo() {
        return 42;
    }

--> demo(): returns a Promise that will eventually resolve to 42 --> Promise<42>
--> await demo(): unwraps that Promise and gives you the actual value --> 42
